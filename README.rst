dgroc: Daily Git Rebuild On Copr

This project aims at easily provide daily build of a project tracked via
git and made available via `copr <http://copr.fedoraproject.org>`_.

Get it running
==============

* Retrieve the sources::

    git clone https://github.com/pypingou/dgroc.git


* Create the configuration file ``~/.config/dgroc``

* Fill the configuration file, for example::

    [main]
    username = me
    email = my_email@example.com
    copr_url = https://copr.fedoraproject.org/
    upload_command = cp %s /var/www/html/subsurface/
    upload_url = http://my_server/subsurface/%s
    #no_ssl_check = True  # No longer required now that copr has a valid cert

    [subsurface]
    git_url = git://subsurface.hohndel.org/subsurface.git
    git_folder = /tmp/subsurface/
    spec_file = ~/GIT/subsurface/subsurface.spec

    [guake]
    copr = subsurface
    git_url = https://github.com/Guake/guake.git
    git_folder = /tmp/guake/
    spec_file = ~/GIT/guake/guake.spec
    patch_files = ~/GIT/guake/guake-0.2.2-fix_vte.patch,
                  ~/GIT/guake/0001-Remove-vte-check-in-the-configure.ac.patch


The Main section
----------------
``username`` The name to use in the changelog of the spec file when updating
it.

``email`` The email to use in the changelog of the spec file when updating
it.

``copr_url`` The url of `copr`_ to use.

``upload_command`` The command to run to make the source rpm (src.rpm, srpm)
available to copr. This can be a copy command (cp) or a copy over ssh (scp).
Note that the ``%s`` is important, it will be replaced by the full path to
the source rpm created.

``upload_url`` The url of the source rpm once it has been uploaded. Note that
here as well the ``%s`` is important as it will be replaced by the source
rpm file name.

For example, if you upload your source rpm onto your fedorapeople space, your
``upload_command`` might be: ``scp %s fedorapeople:public_html/srpms/`` and
your ``upload_url`` might be: ``https://pingou.fedorapeople.org/srpms/%s``.

``no_ssl_check`` Simple boolean to check the ssl certificate when starting
the build on copr. At the moment the ssl certificate is self-signed and thus
invalid. So using the ``https`` version of ``copr_url`` will require a
``no_ssl_check`` set to ``True``.

``copr_config`` The path to a config file with details about COPR connection.
Go to the API page on your COPR instance to get the contents. This is useful if
you want to use dgroc with different copr instances. Defaults to
``~/.config/copr``.

The project section
-------------------

For each project, only three options are required:

``git_url`` The url to the git repository, that is only required if the git
repo is not already cloned on the disk (see ``git_folder``).

``git_folder`` The location of the local clone of the git repository to
build.

``spec_file`` The location of the spec file for the project to build.

``patch_files`` A comma separated list of patches required to build the
project.
These files will be copied over to the rpm sourcedir to be present when
building the source rpm.

``copr`` The optional name of the copr repository to build the package within.
When not set, the project name (from `[]`) is used.

.. Note:: The spec file should be fully functionnal as all ``dgroc`` will do is
          update the ``Source0``, ``Release`` and add an entry in the ``Changelog``.

.. Note:: You might have to set in your spec file the %setup line to::

              %setup -q -n <projectname>


Run the project
---------------

From the sources, it requires few steps:

* Install dependencies::

    yum install libgit2-devel python-virtualenvwrapper

* Create a virtual env::

    mkvirtualenv --system-site-packages dgroc

* Install the python dependencies::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

* Run dgroc::

    python dgroc.py

For more information/output run ``python dgroc.py --debug``


Run dgroc daily
---------------

The easiest way to run dgroc daily is to simply rely on `cron
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron>`_

Here is an example cron entry that you will need to adjust for your setup::

    30 10 * * * python /home/pingou/dgroc/dgroc.py


This cron will run every day at 10:30 am and call the dgroc.py script within the
dgroc clone
